# Overview
This plugin was developed to showcase how to use fragments to create a multi-view/multi-paged layout. 


Our plugin contains 3 fragments a user can swipe through:
1. A home page of buttons to different activities
2. A camera roll that contains photos we've taken on the plugin
3. A color changing page that allows a user to change the background color of the other two pages. 

The code for the tutorial can be found in [demofragments](https://github.com/Toyon/LearnATAK/-/tree/main/demofragments/app/src/main). I recommend loading this plugin onto ATAK and playing around with the features before we dive into the code behind it. Even though the Buttons Pages has six buttons, only the camera button has logic set up behind it in ordSer to minimize the complexity of this tutorial. So don't worry if the other buttons don't do anything -- they are just for demonstration purposes!
