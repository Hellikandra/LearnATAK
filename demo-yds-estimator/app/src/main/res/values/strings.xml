    <string name="app_desc">This plugin uses a trained neural network to estimate the Yosemite Decimal System rating of a hiking or climbing route from user-taken images. Take a photo of a potential route to estimate the YDS class. Ensure that only the specific route in question is within the image (for example, do not include both a maintained trail and a sheer cliff face in the same image). Avoid including non-natural objects in the image, such as people or equipment.</string>
